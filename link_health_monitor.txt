link health monitor monitors the link and declares the static routes inactive, disable the policy-routes and bring down the alert interface (link bring down lan interface if wan goes down)

---last three lines is for actions during dead state of links, i am enabling all three actions--
config system link-monitor
  edit port1-health
    set srcintf port 1
    set server <><><><> --> max of 4 servers to probe
    set gateway <gw ip>
    set protocol ping
    set update-cascade-interface enable
    set upfate-static-route enable
    set update-policy-route enable
  next
end

--configure port 3 as alert interface if port1 is detected dead, port 3 will be made down---
config system interface
  edit port1
    set fail-detect enable
    set fail-detect-option detectserver
    set fail-alert-method link-down
    set fail-alert-interfaces "port3" --> will bring down port3 when port1 is down
